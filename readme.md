## To Dos: (in order of priority)

### Urgent Priority:

- SearchBar is not looking for 'place' key, check options argument and allow for this option;
- RegisterContainers:
    - Add 'select all' toggle in modular header;
    - Put SearchBar out of scroll div;
- Tables: put them inside scroll div (SearchBar outside);

### High Priority:

- Add 'events' version of contract;
- Contract is not verifying CEP on activation;
- Create confirmation message for unmounting pack: "Desmontar pacote e retornar os componentes para o estoque?";
- Check for bugs and errors (bugsnag);
- Billing: make equalValue bool start as true;
- When trying to change page, warn of losing non-saved information;

### Medium Priority:

- Make RegisterContainers/Modular SearchBar to be outside the scrolling div;
- Make All lists sort by description, contracts sorts by id (or date);
- Test Billing with broken values and long remainders, possible to encounter NaN.
- Add server-side security for meteor methods (simple-schema, required fields);
- Fix table in RegisterPacks where it divides the table randomly;
- Create better security for unauthorized users (like checking for userId in meteor methods);
- Create Tag Database;
- Add PlacesTable in Database for future implementations;
- Change order of ContractsTable, recent first, adding date to the table;

### Low Priority: (future implementations)

- Insert Logo on Login scene;
- Add Settings scene for global changes (like the billing charges text);
- Add colors to tables for the different statuses (contracts and products);
- Add name field for users;
- Add the possibility for accessories to be "qualitative" allowing only quantity of 1;
- Make Documents save representatives in Contract;
- Fix trim() tool and apply to Register classes (currently empty spaces count as filled);

### Server security:

- Contract:
    - Block cancelling of contract if status !== from inactive;
- Everything that writes in database (meteor methods) should check for userId, and if the user has access to that functionality;
