## To Dos: (in order of priority)

### Urgent Priority:

-Check if cancelling the contract returns the items (should be able to cancel an active one? ask);
-Mongodb uses indexes and only shows the first 20 documents, see how to work with this!

### High Priority:

-Add 'events' version of contract;
-Contract is not verifying CEP on activation;
-Create confirmation message for unmounting pack: "Desmontar pacote e retornar os componentes para o estoque?";
-Check for bugs and errors (bugsnag);
-Billing: make equalValue bool start as true;
-When trying to change page, warn of losing non-saved information;

### Medium Priority:

-Pages are stored insinde 'profile' key in user object. The profile key is not safe and can be edited, fix this.
  The problem is that apparently publishing Meteor.users.find() won't cause Tracker.autorun to react (old way).
-Test Billing with broken values and long remainders, possible to encounter NaN.
-Add server-side security for meteor methods (simple-schema, required fields);
-Fix table in RegisterPacks where it divides the table randomly;
-Create better security for unauthorized users (like checking for userId in meteor methods);
-Create Tag Database;
-Add PlacesTable in Database for future implementations;
-Change order of ContractsTable, recent first, adding date to the table;

### Low Priority: (future implementations)

-Insert Logo on Login scene;
-Add Settings scene for global changes (like the billing charges text);
-Add colors to tables for the different statuses (contracts and products);
-Add name field for users;
-Add the possibility for accessories to be "qualitative" allowing only quantity of 1;
-Make Documents save representatives in Contract;
-Fix trim() tool and apply to Register classes (currently empty spaces count as filled);
