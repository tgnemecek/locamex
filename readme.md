-Create confirmation message for unmounting pack: "Desmontar pacote e retornar os componentes para o estoque?";
-Create new scene: Dashboard that is accessed by any logged user, redirect from login;
-Contract, ProductSelection: when selecting containers, the packs should appear, create functionality;

-Fix Contract/Documents: when type == 'person', it should read the info from outside client/contacts[];

### High Priority:

-Check for bugs and errors (bugsnag);
-Add server-side security for meteor methods (simple-schema, required fields);
-Block URL navigation for unauthorized users (current method stops links, but not direct URL);
-Add 'events' version of contract;
-When trying to change page, warn of losing non-saved information;

### Medium Priority:

-Create better security for unauthorized users (like checking for userId in meteor methods);
-Fix MenuItem inconsistencies inside AppHeader (sometimes they don't appear);
-Fix trim() tool and apply to Register classes (currently empty spaces count as filled);
-Add CategoryTable and PlacesTable in Database for future implementations;
-Change order of ContractsTable, recent first, adding date to the table;

### Low Priority: (future implementations)

-Add colors to tables for the different statuses (contracts and products);
-Add name field for users;
-Add the possibility for accessories to be "qualitative" allowing only quantity of 1;
